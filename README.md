The solution consists of a centralized database and a mobile app
featuring two portals: Agency and User. Agencies register, providing
essential details like contact information, location, specialization and
availability. Agencies can alert other agencies for assistance and
collaborate via chat or call to better manage the emergency situation.
Users seeking help can send requests to agencies based on disaster type,
proximity and availability. An optional feature allows users to upload
disaster pictures to help agencies assess the scale of the situation.
The help request also includes the user\'s current location for easier
reach. Even without internet access, help requests can be sent via call
or SMS to a preset emergency number, connecting users to relevant
agencies. Both portals include a map displaying nearby agencies,
filtered by specialization and availability. Users can also opt to
donate or volunteer.
